# FEND-Capstone-Travel-App


### This project work with retrieving data from 3 APIs in which one of those is reliant on another to work. 
#### I built a travel application. It’s common to pull basic data from an API, but many applications don’t just pull the weather, they pull in multiple types of data, from different sources and occasionally one API will be required to get data from another API.

### features
##### display length of trip.
##### Display image for the country from Pixabay API.


### Tools: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack, Service workers and Jest.

### Remember that once you clone, you will still need to install everything:
`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`
- `npm run build-prod `
- `npm start to run` 
- `npm run test-dev`
